<p>I recently had the opportunity to do some sediment coring on French Island! We're hoping to learn about the impacts colonisation had on plants and fire regimes. It was a gorgeous place, absolutely teeming with wildlife. </p>

<p>Sadly, gale force winds prevented an archaeology field course from joining us to learn about coring. We we forced to find another way to spend our Sunday afternoon.</p>
