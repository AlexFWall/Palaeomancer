I recently had the opportunity to do some sediment coring on French Island!  
We're hoping to learn about the impacts colonisation had on plants and fire regimes.  
It was a gorgeous place, absolutely teeming with wildlife.

Sadly, gale force winds prevented an archaeology field course from joining us to learn about coring.  
We were forced to find another way to spend our Sunday afternoon.
